# Reporting Security Issues

The KeePassXC team takes security vulnerabilities very seriously and appreciates your responsible disclosure efforts. We will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions and handle them promptly.

To report a security issue, please use one of the following methods:

- **GitHub Security Advisory:** Use the ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/security/advisories/new) tab on our GitHub repository.
- **Private (Encrypted) Matrix Message:** Contact any of the following KeePassXC team members privately:
  - [@droidmonkey_kpxc](https://matrix.to/#/@droidmonkey_kpxc:matrix.org)
  - [@varjolintu](https://matrix.to/#/@varjolintu:matrix.org)
  - [@phoerious](https://matrix.to/#/@phoerious:matrix.org)

Please **do not** use public channels (e.g., GitHub issues) for reporting security vulnerabilities.

Once you report a security issue, our team will respond with the next steps. After our initial reply, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement. We may ask for additional information or guidance during this process.

If you discover vulnerabilities in third-party modules used by KeePassXC, please report them to the maintainers of the respective modules. If the vulnerability impacts KeePassXC directly, we encourage you to notify us using the above methods.

For other inquiries (e.g., developer questions, user questions), please use the public channels on Matrix:
